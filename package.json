To create the database, run 'rake db:migrate' in the terminal.  If you'd like a few seed items, run 'rake db:seed' afterward. Since this is a front and back end project, you'll have to run two servers. I've set up a rake task to do this for you: run 'rake start' to begin running two servers via the foreman gem.  The front end will run on port 3000, and the rails back end on port 3001.",
